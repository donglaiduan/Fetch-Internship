1. I chose to code this activity in python because from my past python knowledge, I knew how to parse through, read, and sort csv files relatively easily using python. I imported csv because that allows me to read in csv files. I used defaultdict so that I could store the parsed contents of the transactions easily, and it allows me to access them easily as well. I used sys so that one can pass in arguments through command line.
2. The advantages of my solution is that this should be able to work for any scenario as long as the general format of the csv file is homogenous. It is not hardcoded and is very generalized. The disadvantage of my solution could be the runtime, as I loop through every transaction, so the time complexity is O(n).
3. So far, my project has been through my coursework. I was assigned to be a frontend developer of a program that would allow for users to search for posts through a reddit thread by title, body, or both. As I developed this project, I had to incorporate numerous interfaces and figure out how they worked, and their expected behavior. Since I was a frontend developer, in order to test my code, I had to hardcode backend solutions first. Once group members were finished with their roles, we had to integrate everything together. This has been my favorite project because this project was the first time I experienced working on a real program with my peers. It was challenging to make sure that my code would be able to integrate with a person working on the backend's code. I had to test extensively, fix bugs that showed up after integration, and it was overall just a process understanding and integrating everything together as I did not completely know what to expect from the backend.
